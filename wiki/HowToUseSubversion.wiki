#summary A quick tutorial on how to use Subversion.

= Introduction =

This is a quick tutorial on how to install AnkhSVN, a subversion plug-in for VS2008, and use it to check out the project code. 

= Prerequisites == 

[http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=3794 AnkhSVN] (2.1.7819) needs to be downloaded and installed.

= Details =

Check out the "SMART LabBench" Solution:
    * Select `File->Open->Subversion Project`
    * Type in `https://4911-smart.googlecode.com/svn/trunk`
    * Browse and select `LabBench/SMART LabBench.sln`. 
    * Click `Open`.
    * Click `OK` and the solution will open automatically

= Notes =
If prompted for a username and password, use your Google account without `@gmail.com`. However, you will need to look up your SVN password [http://code.google.com/p/4911-smart/source/checkout here] by clicking on `When prompted, enter your generated googlecode.com password`.

This will most likely happen when you first try to commit to the repository. It is a wise idea to have it save your password for you.
