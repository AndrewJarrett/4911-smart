# Introduction #

This is a quick tutorial on how to install AnkhSVN, a subversion plug-in for VS2008, and use it to check out the project code.

# Prerequisites #

[AnkhSVN](http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=3794) (2.1.7819) needs to be downloaded and installed.

# Details #

Check out the "SMART LabBench" Solution:
  * Select `File->Open->Subversion Project`
  * Type in `https://4911-smart.googlecode.com/svn/trunk`
  * Browse and select `LabBench/SMART LabBench.sln`.
  * Click `Open`.
  * Click `OK` and the solution will open automatically

# Notes #
If prompted for a username and password, use your Google account without `@gmail.com`. However, you will need to look up your SVN password [here](http://code.google.com/p/4911-smart/source/checkout) by clicking on `When prompted, enter your generated googlecode.com password`.

This will most likely happen when you first try to commit to the repository. It is a wise idea to have it save your password for you.
